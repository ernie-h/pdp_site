      Being culturally attune is something we value greatly. We strive to explore our cultural identity, but more importantly understand its value in today's society. We host a myriad of cultural events and workshops, brining in members that have positively impacted the Asian-American community. Some notable guests include JKFilms, The Shibutani Siblings, The Fung Bros, and Professor Terry Park.
